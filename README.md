## Description


_The Word Definer
Make an application that contains two classes: One for Word, and one for Definition. The homepage of the app should list all words. When a word is clicked, it should lead to a page with the word's definitions. Children should be able to add a word, and when viewing a word, be able to add one or more definitions. This week you should deploy your application to Heroku so the kids can try it out!_
